# MorphologicalDisambiguation

Morphological disambiguation is the problem of selecting accurate morphological parse of a word given its possible parses. These parses are generated by a morphological analyzer. In morphologically rich languages like Turkish, the number of possible parses for a given word is generally more than one. Each parse is considered as a different interpretation of a single word. Each interpretation consists of a root word and sequence of inflectional and derivational suffixes. The following table illustrates different interpretations of the word ‘‘üzerine’’.

üzer+Noun+A3sg+P3sg+Dat  
üzer+Noun+A3sg+P2sg+Dat  
üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P3sg+Dat  
üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P2sg+Dat

As seen above, the first two parses share the same root but different suffix sequences. Similarly, the last two parses also share the same root, however sequence of morphemes are different. Given a parse such as

üz+Verb+Pos+Aor+^DB+Adj+Zero+^DB+Noun+Zero+A3sg+P3sg+Dat

each item is separated by ‘‘+’’ is a morphological feature such as Pos or Aor. Inflectional groups are identified as sequence of morphological features separated by derivational boundaries ^DB. The sequence of inflectional groups forms the term tag. Root word plus tag is named as word form.  So, a word form is defined as follows:

IGroot+IG<sub>1</sub>+^DB+IG<sub>2</sub>+^DB+...+^DB+IG<sub>n</sub>

Then the morphological disambiguation problem can be defined as follows: For a given sentence represented by a sequence of words W = w<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> = w<sub>1</sub>, w<sub>2</sub>, ..., w<sub>n</sub>, determine the sequence of parses T = t<sub>1</sub><sup>n</sup> = t<sub>1</sub>, t<sub>2</sub>, ..., t<sub>n</sub>; where t<sub>i</sub> represents the correct parse of the word w<sub>i</sub>.
